# CPU Scheduling Simulator

A CPU Scheduling Simulator built using React that visually demonstrates how different CPU scheduling algorithms work.
It allows users to input processes, select a scheduling algorithm, and instantly view process tables, performance metrics, and Gantt charts.

This project is useful for Operating Systems learning, visual understanding, and academic demonstrations.

- Deploy Link: https://cpu-scheduling-simulator-m4n6.onrender.com/

# Features

📥 Input custom processes (Arrival Time, Burst Time, Priority)

🔁 Supports multiple CPU scheduling algorithms

# Displays:

- Completion Time (CT)

- Turnaround Time (TAT)

- Waiting Time (WT)

- Visual Gantt Chart

- Performance Metrics:

- Average Waiting Time

- Average Turnaround Time

- Throughput

- CPU Utilization

# Supported Scheduling Algorithms

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)

- Shortest Job First (SJF – Non-Preemptive)

- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)

- Round Robin (RR) (with configurable time quantum)

- Priority Scheduling


🛠️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js

- Styling: CSS / Tailwind CSS

- State Management: React Hooks (useState)

- Visualization: Custom Gantt Chart component

- Language: JavaScript (ES6)


# Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository

`
git clone https://github.com/Sudhanshu611/cpu-scheduling-simulator.git
`

`
cd cpu-scheduling-simulator
`


2️⃣ Install Dependencies

`
npm install
`

3️⃣ Run the Application

`
npm run dev
`

or

`
npm start
`

The app will run at:
👉 http://localhost:5173

# How It Works

- Enter Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority (if required)

- Select a CPU Scheduling Algorithm

- Click Solve

- The simulator:

Generates a scheduling order

Calculates CT, TAT, WT

Renders the Gantt Chart

Displays performance metrics


# Learning Outcomes

- Understand CPU scheduling algorithms visually

- Learn how preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling differ

- Improve understanding of OS performance metrics

- Practice React component architecture and state flow
